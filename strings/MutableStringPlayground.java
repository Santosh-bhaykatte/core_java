* Mutable: The content of a StringBuilder can be changed after it is created.

/*
* When to Use StringBuilder vs. StringBuffer

Use StringBuilder:
* When working in a single-threaded environment.
* When performance is critical (e.g., frequent string manipulations in loops).

Use StringBuffer:
* When working in a multi-threaded environment.
* When thread safety is required.

/*
1. why convert mutable strings to immutable (using toString())
   - For immutability & thread safety
    If you need an immutable copy of your StringBuilder content, converting it to String ensures the content wonâ€™t be modified later.

   - When using equals() for comparison
    StringBuilder does not override equals(), so direct comparison won't work.

   - If a method requires a String type explicitly
    Many APIs (e.g., file handling, networking) expect a String and won't accept StringBuilder.
